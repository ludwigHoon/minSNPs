***

This is a rebuilt version of minSNPs. Its functionality is similar to the original repository, but has cleaner code and less dependencies.

The package has a dependency that is not in CRAN, but in BioC. In order for R to install that, you need to enable BioC repository, this can be done by running `setRepositories()` and selecting both CRAN & BioC Software.
