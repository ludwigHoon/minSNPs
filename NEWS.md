# minSNPs v0.0.1
Rebuilding and cleaning part of minSNPs that read fasta and processes the samples.
## Functions and variables now conform to snake case.
- `get_usual_length` will replace `usualLength`
- `flag_allele` will replace `flagAllel`
- `flag_position` will replace `flagPosition`
- `process_allele` will replace `processAllele`
- `read.fasta` will remain the same, but its implementation is no longer dependent on external package.
